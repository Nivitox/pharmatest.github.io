        "Alternative4": "The prevalence of disease is lower in Community A.",
        "Alternative5": "It is not possible to explain the difference between Community A and B.",
        "Justification1": "A higher prevalence generally increases the positive predictive value of a test, meaning more true positives and potentially more false positives. However, this does not directly explain a lower proportion of false positives among those who test positive.",
        "Justification2": "If the specificity were lower in Community A, this would lead to a higher proportion of false positives in that community, which contradicts the finding. Therefore, this option is not valid.",
        "Justification3": "Higher specificity means that the test correctly identifies more true negatives, resulting in fewer false positives among those who test positive. This is the most plausible explanation for the lower proportion of false positives in Community A compared to Community B.",
        "Justification4": "A lower prevalence would not explain a lower proportion of false positives among those who test positive. In fact, lower prevalence usually results in a higher chance of false positives relative to true positives, assuming the specificity remains constant.",
        "Justification5": "It is not possible to explain the difference between Community A and B: This statement is incorrect, as the difference can be explained by the specificity of the test.",

        "Justification2": "At a sample size of 6,000, the expected events would be: 6000×0.001=6 adverse events. While this would allow for better detection, it exceeds the minimum needed.",

        "Question": "Which of the following would be the most effective method to prevent “inventory shrinkage” due to internal theft within a pharmacy?",
        "Alternative1": "Implementing an employee bag check program at the end of shifts.",
        "Alternative2": "Assigning the responsibility of ordering and receiving inventory to one employee.",
        "Alternative3": "Hiring a uniformed security guard to monitor the pharmacy exits.",
        "Alternative4": "Offering incentives such as employee discounts on merchandise.",
        "Alternative5": "Installing mirrors and security cameras strategically throughout the pharmacy.",
        "Justification1": "This method tackles internal theft by allowing management to inspect employees' personal belongings before they leave. The presence of a bag check serves as a strong deterrent, as employees know they will be scrutinized, effectively reducing opportunities for theft.",
        "Justification2": "While this could create accountability, it may also increase the risk of theft or errors without oversight. If one individual has complete control over ordering and receiving, they could manipulate the system without checks and balances, potentially leading to greater inventory shrinkage.",
        "Justification3": "Although this could help prevent external theft, it may not address the specific issue of internal theft effectively. Employees might still feel empowered to steal when they believe they won't be caught, and the presence of a guard may not deter internal theft as effectively as direct checks of personal belongings.",
        "Justification4": "This could foster goodwill among employees but does not directly tackle the issue of theft. In fact, offering discounts might unintentionally encourage some employees to take advantage of the system or feel entitled to steal if they perceive they are not compensated fairly.",
        "Justification5": "While surveillance can help monitor for theft, it may not be sufficient on its own to prevent internal theft. Employees may still take risks if they believe they can evade detection, and cameras might not catch all incidents or deter opportunistic behavior.",
